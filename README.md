# RSA Digital Signature
A simple Python program with documentation for Cryptography and Information Security
course at Faculty of Electronics of Warsaw University of Technology.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.10
- PyCryptodome module (only for unit tests)

## Functionality
Program implements mechanisms of RSA key generation, signing messages and verfication
of the signature. Those mechanisms are done only with help of standard Python modules
and our own implementations of key algorithms such as extended Euclidean algorithm.

## Usage
Run main.py script and follow the prompt message. Tests have been run through Visual
Studio Code's Python extension, so they have to be performed either through the 
extension or by importing file as a module and calling the methods separately.
